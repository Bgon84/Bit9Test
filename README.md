# Bit9Test
This is a simple PHP application that allows a user to search against The Movie Database. Search results are listed with title and year of release. The user can click on any search result and view movie details. Movie details include the movie poster image, a short overview, and the genres that this movie belongs to.

## Usage
The user will enter a search term into the Search input field. User will then click the Search button. The user will be presented with up to 10 results for their search criteria. Each result will display the movie's title and year of release. Clicking on any search result will then load the movie's details. These details include the movie poster image, a brief overview, and any genres assigned to this movie.   
 
The search input will remain populated with the search term and the user can return to the search results by simply clicking the Search button again. They may then click on another result to see that movie's details.
